The systematic review has been done using a manual search of the published papers in the last 11 years (2006–2016) for the time series forecasting using new neural network models and the used methods are displayed. In the covered period in the study, the results obtained found 17 studies that meet all the requirements of the search criteria. Only three of the obtained proposals considered a process different to the autoregressive of a neural networks model. These results conclude that, although there are many studies that presented the application of neural network models, but few of them proposed new neural networks models for forecasting that considered theoretical support and a systematic procedure in the construction of model. This leads to the importance of formulating new models of neural networks.}

The HI forecaster firstly adopts a novel learning algorithm-based neural network to generate initial sales forecasts and then uses a heuristic fine-tuning process to obtain more accurate forecasts based on the initial ones. The learning algorithm integrates an improved harmony search algorithm and an extreme learning machine to improve the network generalization performance. Extensive experiments based on real fashion retail data and public benchmark datasets were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model is much superior to traditional ARIMA models and two recently developed neural network models for fashion sales forecasting.},

During the last few years, a number of neural network models and hybrid models have been proposed for obtaining accurate prediction results, in an attempt to outperform the traditional linear and nonlinear approaches. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of neural network models which are known to be dynamic and effective in stock-market predictions. The models analysed are multi-layer perceptron (MLP), dynamic artificial neural network (DAN2) and the hybrid neural networks which use generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) to extract new input variables. The comparison for each model is done in two view points: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Deviate (MAD) using real exchange daily rate values of NASDAQ Stock Exchange index.}

  abstract = {Financial time series forecasting is undoubtedly the top choice of computational intelligence for finance researchers in both academia and the finance industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial impact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers have created various models, and a vast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant number of surveys exist covering ML studies on financial time series forecasting. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models have appeared within the field, with results that significantly outperform their traditional ML counterparts. Even though there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time series forecasting, there is a lack of review papers that solely focus on DL for finance. Hence, the motivation of this paper is to provide a comprehensive literature review of DL studies on financial time series forecasting implementation. We not only categorized the studies according to their intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex, and commodity forecasting, but we also grouped them based on their DL model choices, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future of the field by highlighting its possible setbacks and opportunities for the benefit of interested researchers.}

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}",

  abstract = {The relative performances of two optimization algorithms – dual active-set method (DASM) and primal-dual interior-point method (PDIPM) in the implementation of model predictive control (MPC) in terms of input response, CPU time, and number of iteration have been compared with the help of three case studies including MPC of continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in series. The study shows significant improvement of convergence, CPU time, and cost per iteration using DASM for small-scale problem. Both DASM and PDIPM have been observed to be efficient, as the number of iterations is found to be independent of the problem size. Our study also shows that DASM gives better performance over PDIPM.}

 abstract = {We perform a comparative analysis of machine learning methods for the canonical problem of empirical asset pricing: measuring asset risk premia. We demonstrate large economic gains to investors using machine learning forecasts, in some cases doubling the performance of leading regression-based strategies from the literature. We identify the best performing methods (trees and neural networks) and trace their predictive gains to allowance of nonlinear predictor interactions that are missed by other methods. All methods agree on the same set of dominant predictive signals which includes variations on momentum, liquidity, and volatility. Improved risk premium measurement through machine learning simplifies the investigation into economic mechanisms of asset pricing and highlights the value of machine learning in financial innovation.},
